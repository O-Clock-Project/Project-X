## Undefined, the Hub resources for students

Graduation team project 

The school : https://oclock.io/ 


---

**_The purpose :_**



This idea came from our experience in O'clock School. We had a lot of difficulties to find some good resources about the Web development, I mean "validate" resources. So we decided to create a tool. This tool is a HUB where you can find many items about your training period with O'clock ! Especially : a nice validate content library ! 
 
The most important side of this project was to create the HUB himself and a good system for notation of the contents.
