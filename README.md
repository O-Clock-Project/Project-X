# Undefined, the Hub ressources for students

**Graduation team project**

The school : [O'clock](https://oclock.io/)

## The purpose : 

This idea came with our experience in O'clock School. We had a lot of difficulties to find some good resources about the Web development, I mean "validate" resources. So we decided to create a tool. This tool is a HUB where you can find many items about your training period with O'clock ! Especially : a nice validate content library  !

The most important side of this project was to create the HUB himself and a good system for notation of the contents.
